                    What do you think about Patricia and Abel's marriage?"Born a <br>crime" 
                    by Trevor Noah. As I was going through the book I<br>
                     found out<br> that
                     Patricia being a single parent she was an <br>
                     independent woman.<br>
                      She took care of her son and her mother and<br> she never depended on 
                       else for provision.<br>
                       Despite the fact that she was facing some challenges as a <br>
                       single parent,
                        she does not forget her purpose in life. <br>She remains focused and 
                        this made her a happy mother always.<br>
                       Patricia meets a friend Abel who was a mechanic and he becomes her<br>
                        best friend as he used to fix her car every time it used to break <br>down.
                        Their friendship went on for a long time until when<br> Patricia decides 
                        to get married to Abel.
                         Abel came <br>from Tzaneen where women were only raised for marriage. <br>
                         I wonder what convinced Patricia to get married to him because he<br> 
                         was a bhang addict and he was very huge and strong.
                          Trevor says<br> Abel was very hardworking and through his hard work 
                          the mother loved him so much.<br>
                           Patricia thought if they could combine their efforts together<br> 
                           they could have something better.
                             Patricia's marriage to Abel shocks Trevor<br> in that he never 
                             expected them to get married. 
                             After <br>Trevors' biological father had abandoned them Patricia 
                             promised Trevor <br>never to get married again.
                               Do you think it was right for Patricia <br>to get married to Abel?

    Every choice has consequences. After Abel and Patricia's <br>
    union in marriage Abel makes few reforms.<br>
     He stops<br> smoking bhang and starts taking alcohol. This is the moment <br>
     when Abel started becoming wild. He became worse <br>
     than he used to <br>be.
     I remember the time when Trevor fogged the mother's <br>
     signature on the school documents. 
     Trevor says the <br>way Abel punished him had never happened to him before.<br>
      He says "Abel never hit people with a punch". <br>
      He grabbed Trevor's skin on his arms and punched it between <br>
      his thumb and forefinger and twisted hard.
       This made Trevor <br>have nightmares for a long period of time and he started getting <br>
       scared of Abel.
        They started living a hide and sick kind of life.<br>
        This is when Abel starts bringing in the mentality from his village. <br>
        They believe that a man should be in control of everything. <br>He now starts treating 
       Patricia in an awkward way where <br>he even goes ahead to hitting her.

         <p>
            I find it difficult to understand what continue making <br>
            Patricia stick into this marriage after her first beating from Abel. <br>
            Of which, Trevor's dad had never done to her before.<br>
             Patricia's business starts going down since Abel had now taken <br>
             over everything and he was in control. He beats up 
             Patricia <br>the second time and this time round Patricia takes herself to<br>
              the police station.
              The police never took any action instead <br>
              they told her to go and solve their issue at home.<br>
               That was so bad since he had beaten her so badly and she had<br>
                bristles all over her face.
               This continues for so long <br>conflicts after conflicts
                until the time when Abel buys a gun finally <br>shoots
                 Patricia living unconsciously without minding her <br>whereabouts.
                 The way Abel took over the rule over <br>Patricia's life was so terrifying.

</p> 
<p>Abel being brought up in the village where women were being <br>seen
     as a stepping stone brings the same<br> mentality into Patricia's life.<br>
     I stand on<br> the fact that marriage should not be a cage of slavery and sabotage.<br>
     As a woman whether your partner believes in tradition<br> marriage it does't matter.
     Your values should always stand for you.

                <p>BORN A CRIME by Trevor Noah is an interesting book that<br>
                    I have ever read. It is a book filled with a mixture of<br>
                   emotions, happy and sad moments, and all this have been used<br> to 
                   at list pass a message to the readers. Trevor has used hunour<br> in
                    this novel to make it flow with the readers. He uses hunour<br>
                     to make new friends and also on another side it has helped<br> him 
                     get out of trouble during difficult situations.

                  <p> Trevor says back in Soweto he was the only white child the rest<br>
                    were blacks. This helped him make many friends in that<br>
                    whenever black kids saw him they would yell"idonda yomulungu"<br>
                     meaning "The White Man".Some of them would run away others would<br>
                     call their parents to come to look and others would run up and<br>
                     try to touch him to see if he was real, other kids had genuinely<br>
                     no clue white a white person was. He also says ninety-nine point<br>
                     nine percent were black and he was famous in his neighborhood <br>
                     because of his skin color. He was unique and people would give<br>
                      directions using him as a landmark

                Humour also helped Trevor Noah get out of trouble during<br>
                 difficult
                times. I remember the moment when he was playing <br>
                with his cousins<br>
                 Bulelwa and Mulungisi Trevor played the role of being a doctor<br>
                  and Bulelwa a patient, Trevor tried carrying out an operation on<br>
                   her ear using a match stick which ended up breaking in her<br>
                    ear and she started bleeding.

            </p>
                    <p>
                        The grandmother came and punished
                        Bulelwa and Mulungisi leaving <br>Trevor behind. When the mother <br>
                        arrived the grandmother told her to punish him. He brings it out<br>
                        in a funny way saying that the grandmother said she only knows <br>
                        how to punish a black child because when you beat a black child<br>
                        he remains black but a white child turns blue, green, yellow, and then<br>
                        Red. This saved him from being punished by the grandmother
   .
