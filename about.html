            <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
            <img  height="500px" width="400"    src="myimages/IMG-20210428-WA0004.jpg">
            <p> I was born in December 1998 in a family of eleven siblings being the 10th child. 
                I grew  in a small town called Jambini, in Nyandarua county. I started schooling<br>
                at Munyaka primary school where I was able to achieve a good grade and continue<br>
                with my secondary school education. My High school life was  fun and interesting because <br>
                of the friends I had and the effort I used to put in my academics which made me thrive in my performance. 
                At the end of it, I graduated but I did not achieve whatever I intended to get<br>
                I really wanted to join a university and continue with my education but I <br> 
                did not get that chance. As you all know our society value university more than anything else.
                </p>
                
                <p>After high school my life was not easy for I had to look for away 
                    forward.
                     I had to move from my parent's place to the city on my own<br>
                in order to look for greener pastures. Life got more complicated and
                 I had no job nor support from my<br>
                Family. I could cry the whole day until I realized that was doing no good to me. I had to look for a solution<br>
                    to whatever was happening around me.<br>

                    I was lucky that I secured my first job which made me so happy for I could at least afford my basic needs. I did not know<br>
                    that was very little money compared to the responsibilities that I had. I had to pay rent, buy food, renew my <br>
                    closet and all that. At some point it got so hard that I could 
                    not even afford food, I could just drink some water<br>
                    and hope for a better tomorrow
